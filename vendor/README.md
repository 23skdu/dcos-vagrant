# Vendored Dependencies

Vagrant makes using Ruby Gems as dependencies a pain. So instead, dependencies are being vendored into this directory and required by relative path.

## License

Each vendored project has it's own license and license file.

They are all compatible with the parent project's Apache License Version 2.0.
